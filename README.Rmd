The goal of convor is to make data science at Convo easier!

## Installation

You can install the released version of convor from [GitHub](https://github.com/foundinblank/convor) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("foundinblank/convor")
```

## Connections

For now, this package provides easy ways to connect to Convo's databases using the `RMariaDB` package. You'll need to configure that and your `my.cnf` file on your local machine. 

```{r}
# To connect to reporting database
convor::connect_reporting()
```
